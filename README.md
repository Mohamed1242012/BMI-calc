# BMI Calculator

This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator implemented in Python.

## Author

Made by **Mohamed Elsayed**

## Description

This program calculates your BMI based on your weight and height, and categorizes it into different levels:

- Underweight
- Normal weight
- Overweight
- Obesity

My program is based on this BMI Datasheet: [BMI Datasheet](https://mohamed1242012.github.io/bmi_datasheet).

## Usage

Make sure python is installed :
- Debian: `sudo apt install python3`
- Arch: `sudo pacman -Sy python3`

Then clone my repo :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohamed1242012/BMI-calc.git
cd BMI-calc
```

Then run the app :
```bash
python3 main.py
```

Choose wich units you want to use (Type 1 or 2) :
```bash
Which units do you prefer (1 or 2) :
1. Kilograms and Centimeters
2. Pounds and Inches (Feet + remaining inches)
Choose:
```
Then enter your weight and height.

## Future Updates
These are some things I want to add in the future :
- GUI using tinker or pygtk
- Make it support more units
